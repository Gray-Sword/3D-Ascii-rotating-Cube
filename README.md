# 3D-Ascii-rotating-Cube
 This project simulates a rotating 3D cube using ASCII characters in the terminal. It calculates the 3D coordinates of the cube's vertices, applies rotation transformations, and projects the vertices onto a 2D screen. The result is a rotating cube rendered with simple ASCII characters.
